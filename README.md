# About my 4th school project
It is a program that takes data in and outputs an image based on what it read
The data must be formatted specifically, that being one input per line. 
For example, to draw a rectangle that is Blue, you would put on one line of data the Shape, Points, and Color Values
# EX: R (1,1) (4,4) 0 0 255 0 0 255 0 0 255 0 0 255 
The R being Rectangle, the first points being the top left point and bottom right point respectively, and the color values corresponding to each quadrant of the rectangle going clockwise, starting in the top left.
